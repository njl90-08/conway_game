To practice: The Conway Game of Life. 

I'm working on my coding. I read this code in a book and thought I'd try to undertake it. This code should: 1) make a grid, and 2) self-identify grid squares to activate (live) or deactivate (die) based on the squares around it. I believe there are some issues somewhere, but I'm having trouble identifying them.
